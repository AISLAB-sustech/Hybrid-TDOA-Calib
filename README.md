# Hybrid-TDOA-Calib
This project has open source code and data for the article titled "Asynchronous Microphone Array Calibration Using Hybrid TDOA Information". This article aims to solve the calibration problem of asynchronous microphone arrays, which involves using hybrid TDOA and odometry measurements to construct a graph SLAM that simultaneously estimates microphone parameters (microphone positions, time offsets, and clock drift rates) and sound source positions. Simulation and real experiments consistently prove that our method performs better than the existing method.
